`animals[1]`

`animals.push("lion");`

4. Name and describe two additional array methods.

`array.shift()` removes the _first_ item from an array
`array.pop()` removes the last _item_ from an array

5. What are the boolean values in JavaScript?

`true` and `false`

6. In JavaScript, how would you evaluate if `2` is equal to `25`? What is the result of this evaluation?

`console.log(2 === 25);` and the result would be `false`. Additionally `console.log(2 == 25)` would work in this instance as well.
